## Why we made Elementalists
The purpose of this program is simple. With Google Chrome ending support for Adobe Flash Player at the end of this year, people who prefer easy-to-learn games will be left with very few options. The game, Elementalists, is an extremely simple-to-learn game for all ages. The game is based on Rock, Paper, Scissors. Instead, these are referred to as elements and are represented by Fire, Water, and Ice. Unlike Rock, Paper, Scissors, each element has ten different cards that increase in power. This significantly reduces the possibility of a tie, which is typically the least interesting part of the original game. Elementalists also includes a level system that will encourage players to climb through the different levels and play the game even more. Elementalists provides a fun, simple experience to a wide diversity of users.

## Special Features
### Rock Paper Scissors Element
Elementalists features the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors logic but incorporates a numbering system for each different element that reduces the chance of a tie and creates more room for strategy. The cards will be dealt in a random order, keeping the game enjoyable and entertaining.
### Win Conditions
Elementalists features several different ways to win. A player can reach a total of three wins with one single element or can win by winning once with each element. This provides the user with different strategies. A player would be able to “block” the opponent from winning by playing the element that would beat the element the opponent needs to win with.
### Level System
Elementalists features a level system that gives the user a new rank upon a win. This encourages the user to play more in order to rank up and gain new levels.
### Animations
Elementalists features moving characters that represent the different attacks in the game.
